# Predict_Taxi_Fares
Predict Taxi Fares with Random Forests

Datacamp project using R and Jupyter Notebook.

In this project, I'll work with the data from a large number of taxi journeys in New York from 2013.

I'll use regression trees and random forests to predict the value of fares and tips, based on location, date and time.
